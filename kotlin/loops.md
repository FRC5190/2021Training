# Loops
- Practice writing for-loops, while-loops, and forEach statements
- Practice writing a constructor

## Prerequisites
- [Hello World](helloworld.md)
- [Calculator] (calculator.md)

## Instructions
1. Create a new project called `Loops` and a new Kotlin file within your project. Name the file `Main`.
Create your `main` method.

2. Create a new Kotlin class within your project and name it `Loops`. 

3. Create a method called `basicForLoops`. Write four seperate for loops that will...    
    - Part 1: print variable x in 0-10 inclusive
    - Part 2: print variable x in 0-10 not inlusive of 10
    - Part 3: print variable x in 0-10 inclusive skipping every other number
    - Part 4: print variable x in 10-0 inclusive skipping every other number
  
4. Create a method called `forLoops`. Write two seperate for loops.    
    - Part 1: declare a list called `colors` of three string elements. Using a for loop, print each element in the list.
    - Part 2: create a new for loop that will iterate through the index and value of each element in `colors`. In the body of your loop, print the index and value in one line.
  
5. Create a method called `whileLoop`. In your method declare an integer variable named `x` set to 0. Set your loop so that it prints the value of `x` while `x` is less than 10. Remember to increase `x` by 1 in the body of the loop. 
   
6. Create a method called `forEachStatement`. In your method create a list of two string elements and using a forEach statement, print each of the strings.
   
7. Create a method called `delay`. Add two print statements and add code for a 2 second delay between the statements.
   
8. At the top of your `Loops` class, add an initializing constructor that prints `Initialize`
   
9.  Go back to the file with your `main` method. Inside the `main` method, create an instance of your `Loops` class and then call each of the methods from that class. Print the outputs to the console.
