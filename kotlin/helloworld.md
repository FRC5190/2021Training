# Hello World

## Prerequisites
- IntelliJ (IDE)

## Instructions
1. Create a new Kotlin JVM project in IntelliJ: `File` -> `New` -> `Project`. On the left, make sure `Java` is selected, then select `Kotlin/JVM` under `Additional Libraries and Framework`. Press `Next`. Skip the next page, then name your project and set where the project is saved.

2. Once your project loads, click the dropdown on your project folder. Right click the `src` folder and select `New` -> `Kotlin File/Class`. Name the file `HelloWorld`
   
3. Write a method called `main`. The body of the method should print `Hello World` onto the console when the program is run. You can run the program by clicking the green triangle next to your method.
