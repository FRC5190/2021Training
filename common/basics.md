# Programming Basics
This will teach you about the basics of programming if you are new and have no clue where to start. An important tool to all programmers is a search engine, so there is no shame in looking up concepts that you may not understand in-depth.

## Object Oriented Programming
OOP is a framework used to clearly organize your code, which helps with reducing redundant code, reusing code, troubleshooting, and solving complex programming challenges.

## Variables
Variables store pieces of information to be referenced or manipulated.

### Types of Variables:
- `Boolean` - a true or false value
- `Integer` - an integer
- `Double` - any number or decimal
- `String` - a 'string' of text
- `Character` - a single letter/number

There are many other types of variables besides these.

## Methods
Methods are used as a triggerable action, Commonly called functions. Two common uses of functions are `start` and `stop`

## Classes
A class is a template or blueprint used to create a set of objects called instances. The class stores data that is shared by all instances, and is the main container of methods and properties.

## Objects
Objects are single instances of a class, and inherit key aspects from the base class. Objects can have seperate aspects that make them unique.
