# Integrated Development Environment
An IDE is the application you will be using to actually write and compile code. There are many different types of IDEs designed for different languages and developers.

## Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ is an IDE for use with languages like `Java`, `Kotlin`, and `Javascript`. It is very large, meaning it has lots of tools to help you program.

## Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is an IDE for use with almost any language. It is extension based, relying on the community to develop plugins to make coding easier. This means that it is very lightweight and good for scripting languages. However, with no built-in compiler, it is harder to use for some languages. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are different IDEs.
